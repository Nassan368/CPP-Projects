Statistical and Sorting Algorithms in C++
Overview
This project, authored by Adnan Nassan, implements statistical calculations and sorting algorithms in C++. It includes functionality for reading input data, performing various statistical analyses, and sorting numbers using the QuickSort algorithm.


Features
Sorting Algorithms:

Implements the QuickSort algorithm for efficient sorting of numeric data.
Statistical Functions:

Calculate Mean: Average value of a dataset.
Calculate Median: Middle value of a sorted dataset.
Calculate Mode: Most frequently occurring value(s) in a dataset.
Calculate Variance: Measure of the data's spread around the mean.
Calculate Standard Deviation: Square root of the variance.
Identify Outliers: Detects 1x, 2x, and 3x standard deviation outliers.
Perform Linear Regression: Determines slope and intercept for regression analysis.
Input Handling:

Reads data from an input stream (e.g., console or file) until the keyword "end" is entered.
